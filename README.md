# Project Name
Real-Trax

# Overview
A CRUD app built with React and Next.js, Real-Trax was created to help independent artists, musicians, and producers connect with experienced and knowledgeable engineers who have the resources it takes to create professional tracks. 

Being an independent artist is difficult as it is. I's even more difficult if you don't have the equipment or knowledge to take your vision and make it reality! As an artist, you can create projects and assign registered engineers to help bring your musical ideas to life. As an engineer, you can find gigs without interrupting your current projects or wasting precious time attending writer's rounds and independent shows to find potential clients.

# Features

- Sign up using Google Authentication
- Create a profile as an Artist or an Engineer
- As an Artist, you can add details like your name, phone number, email, and title to let Engineers know more about you.
- As an Engineer, you can add all of the same details as the Artist, as well as your daily rate, preferred genres, experience, and a link to your credits or past work.
- Artists can create Projects and outline each Project's requested instruments, genre, tempo, key, and any additional notes/comments for the Engineer. Then, the Artist can choose from any Real-Trax registered Engineer that fits their Project's vibe.
- Once a Project is created, the Artist will have a general overview of their created Projects. They can see the details of their Projects, and edit or delete the Project using the buttons that appear by hovering over the Project name.
- Artists can search for any personal Project or Real-Trax registered Engineer using the search input located in the navbar.
- Once an Engineer is assigned to a project, they can see their booked Projects using the "My Bookings" tab in the navbar.
- Artists and Engineers can go to the "Engineers" tab to see all Real-Trax registered Engineers and filter Engineers by preferred genre.
